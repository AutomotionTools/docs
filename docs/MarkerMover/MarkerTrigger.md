# Using Marker Triggers

Trigger animations on a property with markers. You can set a specific marker comment as a trigger, reference markers on other layers or the active comp, and adjust the timing of the animation.

To apply, select one or more properties and press the 'Apply Marker Trigger expression' button. You can specify a Trigger Name (or leave this blank to trigger on markers with no comments), a Trigger Layer (this is the layer that the markers reside on), and a Trigger Delay (eg. a delay of 0.2 means the animation will play 0.2 seconds after the start of the trigger).

You can adjust the length of the triggered animation by adjusting the duration of the trigger markers. A marker with a duration of zero will play the animation at its original speed.
